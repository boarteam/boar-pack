## **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:boarteam/boar-pack.git
   cd boar-pack
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   This project uses `yarn` for package management. Run:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Understand the monorepo structure**:
   The project uses a monorepo managed by [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) and Yarn Workspaces. All packages are located
   in the `packages` directory.

---

## **Branching and Workflow**

1. **Default branch**: `master`
2. **Feature branches**: Use the format `feature/<short-description>` for new features.
3. **Bugfix branches**: Use the format `bugfix/<short-description>` for bug fixes.
4. **Merge requests**: Create pull requests against `master` and ensure CI checks pass.
